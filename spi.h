/** \file
 *  \brief SPI driver public API
 *
 *  Simple SPI interface. Does not buffer or get driven from
 *  interrupts, but probably should be.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *
 *  + spi_init(): used to create the SPI instance
 *
 *  + spi_conf(): set the bitrate, polarity
 *
 *  + spi_txrx(): submit a single byte to the SPI interface
 *
 *  Note: all handling of CS lines must be done in your own code,
 *  this code does not presume any specific CS state.
 *
 *  Note: you MUST set the port's slave-select pin to OUTPUT if you
 *  intend to use this port in master mode, EVEN IF you don't have
 *  a CS line attached to it.
 *
 *  To Do:
 *
 *  + Make interrupt driven with buffering
 *
 *  + Support slave mode

/** \brief Transmit/Receive SPI data
 *
 *  In SPI, receive and transmit are done at the same time on different lines.
 *  The master set MOSI to the next bit to be sent to the slave, clocks SCK, and
 *  the slave sets MISO to the next bit to be sent to the master before SCK
 *  cycle completes, followed by the master reading MISO for the read bit.
 *
 *  This means a "read" from a slave device is for the master to clock SCK
 *  and read MISO. Conversely, a "write" to a slave device is for the master
 *  to clock SCK with bits already set on MOSI. The other line is effectively
 *  discarded.
 *
 *  This function provides two buffer pointers: one for TX bytes from the master,
 *  and one for RX bytes from the slave to be stored in. They MUST NOT be the same
 *  bufffer, as this seems to cause corruption. If a buffer is NULL the it is
 *  either generated (for TX) or discarded (for RX). The data generated is based
 *  on the txdummy param from spi_conf(). This is required as the SPI master must
 *  generate clocks, which it only does when it has data to transmit.
 *
 *  \param port Name of the port
 *  \param tx_buf A buffer containing len bytes to transmit. May be NULL, this
 *  forces SPI port to transmit zeros (useful for reads).
 *  \param rx_buf A buffer containing len bytes to be written to from receive.
 *  May be NULL, this discards any read data (useful for writes).
 *  \return data received or errors.h
